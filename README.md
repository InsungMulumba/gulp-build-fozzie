Gulp build tasks for use across Fozzie modules.


## Requirements

In order for some of the tasks to be able to run you'll need to prepare your project by following these steps:

1. Install gulp as a dependency

    ```bash
    yarn add gulp
    ```

1. To ensure that the [`scripts:bundle`](#scriptsbundle) task can transpile es2015 code, add the `babel-preset-es2015` preset to the project:

    ```bash
    yarn add babel-preset-es2015
    ```

    Then add a `.babelrc` file, with the `babel-preset-es2015` preset, to the root of your project:

    ```javascript
    {
        "presets": ["es2015"]
    }
    ```

    If you do not add a `.babelrc` file (you may be writing es5 code for example) then the code will be bundled up as is.

1. Add an `.eslintrc` file to the root of your project. The recommended eslint configuration for fozzie modules can be found in [`/fozzie-config/.eslintrc`](https://github.com/justeat/gulp-build-fozzie/fozzie-config/.eslintrc) â€“ simply add the contents of this into your projects `.eslintrc` file to use the JS linting rules we recommend when running the [`scripts:lint`](#scriptslint) task.

1. To use our recommended fozzie stylelint linting rules, add the following into your `package.json` file:

    ```
    "stylelint": {
        "extends": "@justeat/stylelint-config-fozzie"
    }
    ```

    If you wish to extend these rules, you can also define your own `.stylelintrc` file in the root of your project with the rules that you wish to override.


## Setup

To integrate these tasks into your project you need to complete the following steps:

Add `@justeat/gulp-build-fozzie` to your project

```bash
yarn add @justeat/gulp-build-fozzie
```

Inside your gulpfile require and then run `@justeat/gulp-build-fozzie` passing `gulp` as the first argument, You can optionally [pass in options here which will override the defaults](#options).

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const build = require('@justeat/gulp-build-fozzie');

build(gulp, /*options*/);
```

That's it! You can now run any of [the Gulp tasks](#the-gulp-tasks).
